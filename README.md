# Why build a finance application?
I first started investing in 2022. I wanted a platform in which I could take a look on how many stocks I was in hand. I wished I could filter them by paramethers, in order to visualize
the amount of each stock was under my possession. I came across this idea, and it turned out to be an amazing exeperience to develop this projet.

# External APIs used for this project
> In order to use google OAuth, i used the google gapi [Google Auth API](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference).
> 
> To store data, I used the faunadb service [Fauna DB](https://fauna.com/).

Finally, a .env file must be filled with some api keys â¬‡
* The google gapi api needs you to create a project and a secret api key, so the OAuth service will be available.
* The faunaDB requires some API keys as well.

On the .env.example, you should find the apis key names. Just put your secrets and you will be ready to go!
